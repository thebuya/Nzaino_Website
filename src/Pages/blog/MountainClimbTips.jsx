              Ensure you have an adequate supply of food and water for the

                5. Acclimatization and Altitude Sickness:{" "}
              </span>
              <br />
              Mountain Rwenzori reaches altitudes above 5,000 meters (16,400
              feet), which increases the risk of altitude sickness. Proper
              acclimatization is crucial to minimize this risk. Plan your climb
              with gradual altitude gain, allowing your body time to adjust.
              Take regular rest days, stay hydrated, and listen to your body's
              signals. If symptoms of altitude sickness persist or worsen,
              descend to a lower altitude immediately.
